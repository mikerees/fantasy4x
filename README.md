# Fantasy 4x

Fantasy 4x is an aptly named skeleton project for a web based, fantasy themed game in the 4x genre. As the name suggests. It is built upon Laravel 5.7 and is intended for small scale use.

This project is primarily a learning project for myself. If you're interested in contributing please see the section down below.

## Features

This project is not currently fully functional. Use at your peril. Functionality has only been used in a test environment. No user interface has been developed as yet. With all that said...

* A kingdom can construct and upgrade buildings
* Buildings can provide resources passively

## Still to Come

* Further functionality for buildings (creating units, casting spells, costing resources)
* Active actions
* Recruiting units and forming companies
* Marketplace
* Kingdom creation, management and actions
* User Interface
* Interaction between users and kingdoms
